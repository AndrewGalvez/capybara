# Capybara

A CPP game made using raw sockets.

Oh, you don't like raw sockets? I don't either, I just suck at refactoring.

## Gameplay

### Start
On starting the game, it will ask you for your name and color. Use the keyboard to enter name and arrows to select color. You can press ";" to save your settings.
Press enter to start.

### Movement
Use WASD to move around.

### Shooting
Click in the direction you want to shoot to fire a bullet. You can use the minimap to see player locations.
